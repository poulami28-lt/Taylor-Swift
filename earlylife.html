    <h1><i>Early Life</i></h1>
    <p><big>Taylor Alison Swift</big> was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania. Named after singer James Taylor, she was raised by her father, Scott, a stockbroker, and mother, Andrea, a marketing executive. She has a younger brother, Austin, and her family has Scottish, English, German, and some Italian and Irish roots. Her grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, an opera singer, deeply influenced her love for music.

    Taylor spent her childhood on a Christmas tree farm and summers in New Jersey, where she occasionally performed. She attended Montessori and Wyndcroft schools, later moving to Wyomissing, and eventually to Hendersonville, Tennessee, to pursue music. Inspired by artists like Shania Twain and Faith Hill, she started performing locally. At 11, she went to Nashville with demo tapes but was rejected. She began songwriting and learned guitar at 12. At 13, she signed a development deal with RCA and completed high school via homeschooling, graduating early.</p>
