    <h1><i>Career Beginnings & First Album</i></h1>
    <p>In Nashville, Taylor Swift collaborated with seasoned songwriters and formed a strong partnership with Liz Rose, meeting weekly to write songs. At 14, she became the youngest signee at Sony/ATV Music Publishing but later left RCA over creative differences. In 2005, after performing at the Bluebird Café, she caught the attention of Scott Borchetta and signed with his new label, Big Machine Records—her father even bought a 3% stake. Her self-titled debut album, released in 2006, featured songs she wrote or co-wrote and became a major success, spending 157 weeks on the Billboard 200. Singles like “Tim McGraw,” “Teardrops on My Guitar,” and “Our Song” gained popularity, with the latter making her the youngest artist to write and sing a No. 1 country hit. She toured as an opening act for big names and released two EPs. The album earned her multiple awards and a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist.</p>
