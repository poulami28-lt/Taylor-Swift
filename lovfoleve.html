    <h1><i>Lover Folklore & Evermore</i></h1>
    <p>In 2018, Swift signed with Universal Music Group, securing ownership of her future masters. Her 2019 album Lover topped global charts and became the best-selling album in the US that year. It featured hit singles like “Me!”, “You Need to Calm Down”, and “Cruel Summer”. Amid a public dispute with Scooter Braun over her old masters, Swift began re-recording her past albums in 2020. During the pandemic, she surprise-released Folklore and Evermore, indie-folk albums that topped charts and earned critical acclaim. Folklore won Album of the Year at the 2021 Grammys, making her the first woman to win the award three times. Swift was the highest-paid artist of 2020 and won multiple American Music Awards. She also starred in Cats (2019) and was featured in the documentary Miss Americana.</p>
