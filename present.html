    <h1><i>The Eras Tour & Tortured Poets Department</i></h1>
    <p>In March 2023, Taylor Swift launched the record-breaking Eras Tour, covering her entire discography and becoming the highest-grossing tour in history. Its concert film grossed over $250 million, and the accompanying photobook sold over a million copies in its first week. In April 2024, she released her eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, which broke streaming and chart records worldwide, including the first album to hit one billion Spotify streams in a week. Following massive success with her music, touring, and re-recordings, Swift reached new heights of global fame and was Spotifyâ€™s most streamed artist again in 2024. She purchased the masters of her first six albums in May 2025. Swift began dating NFL player Travis Kelce in 2023. In 2024, she faced a wave of AI-generated abuse, death threats, and concert cancellations due to terrorist threats, reflecting the intense public scrutiny surrounding her fame.</p>
