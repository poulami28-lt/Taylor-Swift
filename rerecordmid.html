    <h1><i>Re-recordings & Midnights</i></h1>
    <p>In 2021, Taylor Swift began re-recording her first six albums, starting with Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version), both of which topped the Billboard 200. "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" and "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)" achieved record-breaking chart success. Her 2022 album Midnights, a mix of electropop and synth-pop, debuted with over a million US sales in its first week and made her the first artist to claim the entire Hot 100 top 10, led by "Anti-Hero." She became the highest-paid solo artist globally in 2021 and won multiple awards, including Grammys for Midnights and All Too Well: The Short Film. In 2023, she released Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) and 1989 (Taylor’s Version), both of which broke chart and sales records, with 1989 (Taylor’s Version) becoming her sixth album to sell over a million copies in a single week. She also collaborated with artists like Big Red Machine, Haim, Ed Sheeran, and The National, and earned award nominations for "Carolina" from Where the Crawdads Sing. That same year, Swift became the most-streamed artist on Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, and the first to top Billboard’s year-end artist chart in three different decades.</p>
